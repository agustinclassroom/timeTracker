# timeTracker 
A time-focused goal and habit tracker written in JavaScript.

### Plan 
- Communicate front-end with back-end.
- Use prompt to send data to the back end. 
- Use fs to store this data in files.
- Build a basic GUI to input data.
- Find a way to visualize this stored data. Likely going to need to use React.
